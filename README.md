# Water-Shader
This is a shader project I have created using CG/C# in unity. I have created a water shader which will react when an object is dropped in the water object.
Throughout this project I used my existing knowledge of shaders and C# to create a toon-like water shader which can be used for more stationary bodies of water as the shader is not designed to flow like a river or stream.
